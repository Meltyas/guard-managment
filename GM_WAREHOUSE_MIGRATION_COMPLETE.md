# GM Warehouse Migration to DocumentBasedManager - COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully migrated GM Warehouse Dialog from localStorage to DocumentBasedManager for proper Foundry VTT data persistence.

## Changes Made

### 1. GMWarehouseDialog.ts Migration

- **getResourceTemplates()**: Changed from `resourceManager.getAllResources()` to `documentManager.getGuardResources()`
  - Made method async to handle Promise return
  - Updated return type to `Promise<any[]>`

- **handleAddResource()**: Changed from `resourceManager.createResource()` to `documentManager.createGuardResource()`
  - Updated to use DocumentBasedManager instead of ResourceManager
  - Maintained async flow for resource creation

- **refreshResourcesTab()**: Made async to handle new async getResourceTemplates()
  - Properly awaits resource template loading
  - Updates UI when resources are loaded

- **renderResourcesTab()**: Updated to show loading state initially
  - Resources are loaded asynchronously via `loadInitialContent()`

- **loadInitialContent()**: New method to load resources when dialog opens
  - Called during dialog initialization
  - Ensures resources are loaded before user interaction

### 2. Data Flow Changes

**Before**: GMWarehouseDialog → localStorage → ResourceManager
**After**: GMWarehouseDialog → DocumentBasedManager → Foundry Documents (guard-resource Items)

### 3. Benefits of Migration

- ✅ **Proper Foundry Integration**: Uses Foundry's document system instead of localStorage
- ✅ **Permission Handling**: Respects Foundry's user permissions (GM vs Player)
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: Resources persist across sessions in Foundry's database
- ✅ **Synchronization**: Supports real-time sync between multiple clients
- ✅ **Backup/Export**: Resources included in Foundry world exports

## Testing

Use `test-warehouse-migration.js` to verify the migration works correctly:

```javascript
// In Foundry console
testWarehouseMigration();
```

## Code Architecture

### Resource Creation Flow

1. User clicks "Add Resource Template" in GM Warehouse
2. AddOrEditResourceDialog opens with `gm-warehouse-templates` organizationId
3. User fills form and confirms
4. `handleAddResource()` calls `documentManager.createGuardResource()`
5. DocumentBasedManager creates Foundry Item with type 'guard-management.guard-resource'
6. `refreshResourcesTab()` reloads and displays updated resource list

### Resource Loading Flow

1. GM Warehouse dialog opens
2. `loadInitialContent()` calls `refreshResourcesTab()`
3. `refreshResourcesTab()` calls `getResourceTemplates()`
4. `getResourceTemplates()` calls `documentManager.getGuardResources()`
5. DocumentBasedManager queries Foundry Items with type 'guard-management.guard-resource'
6. Resources displayed in GM Warehouse UI

## Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The GM Warehouse Dialog now properly uses Foundry's document system for data persistence, eliminating the inappropriate use of localStorage for module data.
